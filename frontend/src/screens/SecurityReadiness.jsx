            Registration requires an affirmative privacy choice and the service provides
            data access and deletion tools. The operating organization still needs to
            confirm its Data Fiduciary obligations, notice language, consent management,
            grievance process, retention rules, cross-border restrictions, and any
            Significant Data Fiduciary duties.

            This page is not a HIPAA Notice of Privacy Practices. RaktaSetu's status as a

            scope has not been legally determined.

          <p>
            If RaktaSetu creates, receives, maintains, or transmits protected health
            information for a covered entity, the operating organization must complete a
            HIPAA scope analysis and implement all applicable administrative, physical,
            and technical safeguards.
